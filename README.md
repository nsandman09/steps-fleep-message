# Fleep Message step

Send a [Fleep](https://fleep.io) message from your [bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io/cli) build!


## How to use this Step
If you want to use your step in your project's `bitrise.yml`:

1. git push the step into it's repository
2. reference it in your `bitrise.yml` with the `git::PUBLIC-GIT-CLONE-URL@BRANCH` step reference style:

```
- git::https://github.com/nsandman09/steps-fleep-message.git@master:
   title: Send Fleep Message
   inputs:
   - message: The build succeeded! The project has been successfully compiled and
            is available at $BITRISE_PUBLIC_INSTALL_PAGE_URL.
   - message_on_error: The build failed! The project could not be built.
   - webhook_url: https://fleep.io/hook/â€¦
```

You can find more examples of step reference styles
in the [bitrise CLI repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_examples/tutorials/steps-and-workflows/bitrise.yml#L65).
